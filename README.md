The goal of this project was to create a self-balancing two-wheeled robot, a goal the team completed well ahead of schedule.  As the developer of most (nearly all) of this robot's control system, I've added this repository to my public Github account as a code sample.

Our final robot was able to balance indefinitely on two wheels, respond to outside impulses, and adapt to varying loads through the use of a sensor that measured rotational velocity.
